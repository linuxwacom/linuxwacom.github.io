  <h2 class="one">Welcome to The Linux Wacom Project!</h2>
  <p class="one">The Linux Wacom Project manages the drivers, libraries, and documentation for configuring and running Wacom tablets under the Linux operating system. Our drivers are pre-installed in many major distributions and provide out-of-the box support for a wide variety of Wacom tablets and TabletPCs.<br></p>
  <p class="one">Oftentimes, you can simply plug in your tablet and start working. However, in some cases a model may be too new (or obscure) to be supported out of the box. It may also be that your system is missing the necessary drivers for some reason. In these cases, our three packages below may help. Each serves a different purpose and not all are necessary. Please click on the links to get information on how to install each. Our current drivers are compatible with most distributions released since 2010.<br></p>
  <p class="one">Before proceeding, please use your distribution's package manager to perform a system update. This will ensure the latest drivers and utilities are installed and in some cases may be sufficient on its own to get a new tablet working.</p>
  <h2 class="one">Which software do you need?</h2>
